# playground

This is an "app" designed to work with a 433Mhz module to control the cheap remote power outlets you can pick up at a lot of places.

The software uses Dojo Mobile widgets loaded via CDN, to provide a themed look for each platform.  Though the android style is looking quite dated.

The app/website is served from an SD card on an Arduino.
